# Score-More ReadMe

## What is Score-More?
Score-More is a live scoreboard app that lets each individual in a room keep their score when pen & paper isn't an option, and keeps a group from needing 1 dedicated score keeper.
Creating a room generates a 4 letter room code (no vowels) and sends you to that room. People can join using the room code on the home page.


## What did I use?
Runs on Node.js using express.
Handles users with socket.io and redis
